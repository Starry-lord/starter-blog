## About Death By Neon

### Self taught, retro oriented

As a Swiss citizen, Death By Neon has had a lot of time to enjoy the Mountains. Except he has always prefered watching horror movies instead. Since an early age, he was always pressuring his parents to watch mature rated horror movies that were the current fuss. With a watch-time simply impossible to calculate, he managed to acquire a deep passion and interest for movie scores, and synthetizer made music, from old school berlin school, to the midnight, in more recent times.

Death By Neon has also contributed to the American movie industry a couple times, crafting music to fortify scenes and ambiances, as well as making memorable themes.
